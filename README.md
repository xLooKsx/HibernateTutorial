# HibernateTutorial

Just a repositorie to test and study hibernate, nothing too fancy

You will need to dowload those jars and put in your project

MySQL JDBC connector -> https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/
Hibernate -> https://sourceforge.net/projects/hibernate/files/hibernate-orm/5.6.5.Final/

There is a SQL folder inside the project, you will find sql files to create the database and table there
